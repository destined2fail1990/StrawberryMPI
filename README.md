Annoying example of a standardized install script for use with a Raspberry PI + Touch Display

Essentially, this is an old PI 3 or 4 max snapped with a 5-7" display that works over USB to a PC working as a ISO Storage + HID device (keyboard) w/ VGA? Simulates keystrokes of your batch/shell scripts. No internet so they cannot be touched. Every checksum is verified by the device using simple OCR. Prints receipt with install log & OS verify & final checksum?

ISO Storage = Virtual USB. Readonly. Bootable?
VGA Adapter = Virtual USB?
HID Device  = Virtual USB
Printer     = Virtual USB

Virtual HUB?
